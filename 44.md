Dear Jon, 

One of my oldest and best friends. I can still remember the day you moved over from Herzlia Weizmann to Constantia. Who would have thought, looking forward more than 20 years that we would be such close friends. Not only do you have an incredibly sense of humour, youâ€™re bloody smart, loyal and caring. I love how likeminded we are, often finding ourselves on the same side of any argument. I want you to know that I truly value and appreciate your friendship. 

Especially over the last few years, as Romy and Zia have become central to our respective lives, it means so much to me that the four of us get along so easily and so well. 

It would mean so much to me if you would be a groomsman and part of our retinue at our upcoming wedding.

Love you man,

Kev
