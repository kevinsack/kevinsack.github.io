Dear Naba

You and I go way back, and have always gotten along really well and it's been so great these last few years how much that friendship has developed. Sure, you're in JHB now and we spend less time together (which sucks btw), but I truly consider you one of my closest friends and really value our friendship. It's not just me, Zi also treasures your friendship. It would mean so much to both of us that you if you would be a groomsman at our upcoming wedding and be a part of our retinue.

Love you man,

Kev
