Dear Shaunie

Man... do we go way back. I remember when we met: being an awkward 6th grader, braces, thickly gelled middle-parted hair, wearing alien t-shirts and camo jeans. Somehow I was dating Carly Dorfman, and was pressured into meeting and befriending her best friend's boyfriend. I think I still remember the advice you gave me after knowing me for barely a few minutes. You said that when a kissing a girl, you prefer to put your entire mouth inside of hers before slipping in some tongue. This may be the best advice I’ve ever received and still serves me well to this day.

Who could have imaged, twenty years later, that we would be such close friends. We’ve had a friendship that has spanned not only decades, but continents too.  I’ve treasured it, and all the incredible experiences we’ve shared together. 

With my upcoming wedding, I’d be honoured to have you as a groomsman and can’t imagine doing it without you. 

Love you man,



Kevin
