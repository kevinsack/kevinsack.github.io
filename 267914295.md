Dear Yona

I know we go way back, but it feels like over the past few years our friendship has really blossomed. You are undoubtably one of my closest and most trusted friends, and it's easy to see why. You have one of the sharpest minds I know and a killer sense of humour to accompany it. You're also highly principled and I have to say how much I admire the work you do and how you've dedicated yourself to it. 

Both Zi and I treasure your friendship. It would mean so much to us if you would be a groomsman and part of our retinue for our upcoming wedding.

Love you man,

Kev
