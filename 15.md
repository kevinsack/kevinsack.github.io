Dear Gary

I am proud to consider you one of my closest friends. Over the last few years in particular that friendship has grown from strength to strength - you are my ally in science, DIY, and humour. On top of all of this, you really are an exceptional friend. Not just to me, but also to Zi, who also treasures your friendship.

It would mean so much to us if you would be a groomsman at our wedding and a part of our retinue.

Love you man,

Kev
