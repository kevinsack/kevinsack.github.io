Dear Marc,

Over the last few years our friendship has really grown into something beautiful. I'm writing this, by the way, on the eve of our weekend away together - I'm so glad we still get to do romantic things together after all these years.

Over the last few years the four of us have (us and the bitches) have grown closer and closer. Both figuratively and literally â€“ I love that we live on opposite sides of the street! Through Plett excursions, fish face selfies, matching Tikkis and sneaker shopping, our friendship has grown and grown.

I also love how we have a close friendship independently. You are an incredible friend, the turkleton to my vanilla bear, and it would be an honour if you would be a groomsman at my upcoming wedding.

Love you man,


Kev
