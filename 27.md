Dear Murky, 

Your friendship means so much to Zi and I. It's been a pleasure to get to you know you over this time as our friendship has developed. Zi and I hate that we no longer all live in the same city. I guess we'll have to party extra hard at the wedding to make up for it! We can't imagine getting married without you there and would be honoured if you joined our retinue as a groomsman. 

Love you man,
Kev

PS- I give you a hard time, but the truth is that I seem to have a real soft spot for crazy little left-handed weirdos.
