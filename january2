Dear Ad,

My oldest friend, my first companion, my brother from the same mother,

I count myself incrediby lucky to have you as an older brother. You've always had my back, every since I was a skinny shtilim kid and it was raining too hard. How many brothers have had the oppertunity that we've had to not only share our childhood but to also share our young adulthood. Running Habo and and living with you have been some of the best years of my life. As Zi and I start this new chapter, I can't imagine doing nay of it without you - once again I need you to have my back in the build up and during our wedding.

Will you be my bestman, our MC for the wedding, and overlord of the groomsman?

I love you

Kev
