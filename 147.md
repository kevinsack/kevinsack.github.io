Dear Barn,

We go way back. I knew back in 1998, when you told me that sunblock t-shirts weren't cool enough to attract chicks that we'd soon become great friends. Who would know that we would one day live together on a Kibbutz, run a youth movement together and ocassionaly squeeze each other's bums when no one is looking.

I treasure our friendship and would be honoured if you would be a groomsman at my wedding this year.

Love you man,

Kev
