Dearest Rich

You are one of my oldest and closest friends. We have been through some incredible experiences together: from late night converstaions out in the cold Constantia evenings to outrageous adventures in India. I was so incredibly happy for you when you became a father a few months ago, but also a little sad that I couldn't be there personally to celebrate with you. Which makes me all the more appreciative that you'll be joining Zi and I for our wedding later this year.

It means so much to me that you've already agreed to be a groomsman at our wedding. We go back a long way and I couldn't possibly imagine what it would be like to get married without you by my side. This friendship of ours, it spans decades, continents and now (with the arrival of Olivia) hopefully it will span generations ;). 

Love you man

Kev
